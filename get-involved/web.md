Every day, government spending makes headlines. At OpenSpending, we
want to help the public put the numbers in perspective by showing how
the news relates to spending data.

**The News and Website team run the blog and websites, write up stories about money and finances and track coverage of public finances in the news.**

## What Do We Do?

As a member of the News and Web team, you can be involved in things like:

* **Track down "spending stories"** – help find and report on the connections between stories in the media and the world of public finances - government budgets, spending, contracts etc – such as <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-18/detroit-becomes-biggest-u-s-city-to-file-for-bankruptcy.html">Detroit’s bankruptcy</a>. Specifically:
* Collect and share news stories about spending and budgets.
* Find the spending data behind the news stories and write about it on our blog.
* **Edit the Blog**: oversee our blog with latest OpenSpending news including soliciting and editing contributions, writing roundups and news stories and more!
* **Oversee and manage our social media** – Facebook, Twitter etc. Explore new social media outlets (e.g. Tumblr).
* **Resources for journalists**. Write materials to help journalists and citizens dig into spending, understand tax (evasion), or create the next story about the <a href="http://openspending.org/resources/eu/index.html">EU budget</a>
