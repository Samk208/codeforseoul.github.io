The EAGF is solely funded by the EU budget and encompasses two types of measures: (a) Income support for farmers (direct payments), (b) Market-support measures. Shared management rules:the Member States work through national or regional paying agencies which must be accredited on the basis of a set of criteria laid down by the Commission. Expenditure made by the paying agencies is reimbursed by the Commission to the Member States on a monthly basis in the case of the EAGF. Only one grant is centrally managed by the European Commission when it comes to the CAP.
