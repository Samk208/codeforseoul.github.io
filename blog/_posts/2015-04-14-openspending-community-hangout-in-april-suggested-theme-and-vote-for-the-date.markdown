As some of you may know already, I'm delighted to now be working with the Open Spending community as community manager. I really look forward to meeting you all at our <strong>April Community Hangout</strong>!

<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Going forward, w</span>e thought it might be a good idea to plan each of our <span class="il">hangouts</span> around a theme - since a general election is fast approaching in the UK, we're proposing we focus in April on <strong>UK Government <span class="il">Spending</span></strong>.</div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This might include financial forecasts, discussions around the UK government's deficit, <span class="il">spending</span> pledges in the manifestos of the political parties and so on. Is the UK really the world's fastest growing 'major' economy?, as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/news/reality-check/2015/apr/01/clarify-uk-not-worlds-fastest-growing-major-economy" target="_blank">George Arnett has asked</a>. And did the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/apr/07/did-the-last-labour-governments-really-hike-taxes-by-1895-a-year" target="_blank">last Labour governments really hike taxes by £1,895 a year</a>? </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">As well as the themed discussion, there'll also be space for <strong>lightning talks and short updates</strong> from around the community - if you are interested in giving one on your project or work please just add to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/1_59aF9SPubHnkLAnGN2cF2Be5ANGqxCJOak4MeAsKJs/edit#heading=h.aupboiaxhxgv" target="_blank">draft agenda</a>.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It'd be brilliant to have as many of our community there as possible, so please indicate your availability in <a href="http://doodle.com/rg5a643yt6g34gih" target="_blank">this doodle poll</a>. As usual, it'll be via Google <span class="il">Hangout</span> (link to be sent nearer the day). </span></div>
