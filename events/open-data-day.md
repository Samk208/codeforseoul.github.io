Help open up your local city finances by publishing them on OpenSpending and producing elegant visualizations that show where money goes.

OpenSpending makes it super-easy to turn an Excel (or even PDF) file of local city finances into something browsable and searchable. It also enables you make clear and beautiful visualizations of your local city’s finances in seconds making them understandable to everyone.

There are 3 simple steps.

1. Find the data - locate your local city or municipal data
2. Prepare the data - turn into a single clean spreadsheet in Excel, Libreoffice or Google Docs (and then export as CSV - just “save as”)
3. Upload to OpenSpending and visualize
