The EMFF is used to co-finance projects, along with national funding: each Member State is allocated a share of the total fund budget, based on the size of its fishing fleet, then each Member State draws up an operational programme detailing how it intends to spend the money, the Commission approves the programme and then national authorities decide which projects will be funded, national authorities and the Commission are jointly responsible of the implementation of the programme.
