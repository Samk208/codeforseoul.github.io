Have you got data you want to load? Or do you like sharing your skills
for working with financial data? Would you like to help other
community members to clean and prepare data?

Join the Data team and help to prepare and load data into OpenSpending
and to support community members with data-related issues.

## Jump In

Easiest way to get started is by jumping on the mailing list and
saying hello or by checking out the data team issue tracker to see
where help is needed with datasets.

* [OpenSpending Data Wrangling mailing list][list] - open to everyone interested in data side of things
* [Data team issue tracker][datatoload] - we manage our list of datasets we are working on in this issue tracker
* [Data Team guide][guide] - detailed data team guide (especially useful for new joiners)

## More Information

### What Data Team does

As a member of the Data Team you will help prepare and upload data to
OpenSpending. You’ll work on things like:

* Clean the data: Spending data often suffer from being messy and full of peculiar errors. You will be there to give the data some care and attendance with tools such as <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/recipes/cleaning-data-with-refine/">Open Refine</a> to fix the mess.
* Sanity check: Sometimes <a href="http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/22/reinhart-rogoff-revisited-why-we-need-open-data-in-economics/">a sanity check</a> from you is needed to confirm that the numbers add up and that the budget actually makes sense.
* Format the data: You will need to fit the data for the OpenSpending <a href="http://openspending.org/help/data-loading.html">load function</a>.
* Keep track of spending data waiting in line at the <a href="http://progress.openspending.org/">Progress Page</a>. At OpenSpending we would like to upload datasets quickly after their discovery.
* Share tips and tricks on how to work with spending data with the community of users at our Data Clinics, trainings and Spending Data Parties.

### Qualifications

The most important requirement is enthusiasm! In addition, if you know
how to use a spreadsheet and what a CSV file is that’s more than
sufficient. We have a strong community who can help you grow your data
skills. Programming skills and detailed knowledge of budgets is a plus
but not required;-)

We will provide a short induction on how to work with OpenSpending and
you will also have your peers in the data team to help out.

We generally coordinate the work in Spending Data sprints, where you
and the team upload a series of datasets within a designated period of
time (e.g. 2 weeks). By working in sprints you can contain the
required workload, while still harvesting the benefits of working
closely with fellow data wranglers via IRC, Skype and Hangout. We
emphasize that work can also be done asynchronously -- so if, say, you
only have an hour free every Sunday at a particular time, that’s
absolutely fine too!

We will feature your profile on the OpenSpending site along with the
rest of the Data Team.
