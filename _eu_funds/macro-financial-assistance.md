The decision to grant MFA to a third country is proposed by the Commission and then approved by the European Parliament and the Council. The amount of the aid granted is decided on a case-by-case basis by the EU in consultation with international financial institutions. Certain conditions, such as the respect of human rights, have to be met. A Memorandum of Understanding is signed between the EU and the beneficiary country.The aid usually takes the form of a loan and, in somecases, of a grant.
