EU Member States decide which measures are best suited for their specific needs and manage the programmes themselves, whilst the EU pays parts of the costs (co-financing). Shared management rules: the Member States work through national or regional paying agencies which must be accredited on the basis of a set of criteria laid down by the Commission. Expenditure made by the paying agencies is reimbursed by the Commission to the Member States on a quaterly basis in the case of the EAFRD. Only one grant is centrally managed by the European Commission when it comes to the CAP.
