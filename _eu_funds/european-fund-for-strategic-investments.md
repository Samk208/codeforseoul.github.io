title: European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI)
objectives: |-
  To support strategic investments such as in broadband and energy networks, as well as smaller companies with fewer than 3000 companies.
  This fund was only recently established and is therefore not included in the current MFF regulation (this explains the 0 in column F). The money necessary for its functioning will be provisioned on the basis of existing budget reserves and of the reallocation of certain, limited amounts for the Connecting Europe Facility and Horizon 2020.
